# SmokeSignals AI: Company Abstract

## Overview

SmokeSignals AI is a go-to-market (GTM) consultancy that builds signal-driven revenue systems for B2B SaaS companies. Founded by Nick Zeckets, the company operates at the intersection of GTM strategy and intelligent automation—helping growth-stage companies escape "AI tool chaos" and build systematic, measurable pipeline infrastructure.

The core thesis: **Most companies have bought into AI tools without buying into strategy.** SmokeSignals fills that gap.

## The Problem We Solve

B2B companies in the Seed-to-Series-C stage face a predictable inflection point:

- **Product-market fit is achieved.** Customers exist. Revenue flows.
- **Founder-led sales hits a ceiling.** What worked at 10 customers breaks at 100.
- **Tool proliferation creates chaos.** Teams bolt together AI SDRs, enrichment platforms, and automation tools without strategic integration—creating what Nick calls the "Frankenstein AI" problem.
- **GTM infrastructure gaps emerge.** Companies hire SDRs without playbooks, buy HubSpot without optimizing it, and launch outbound without signal-driven targeting.

The result: wasted spend, burned TAM, unpredictable pipeline, and sales/marketing misalignment.

## Our Approach: Signal-Driven GTM

SmokeSignals operates from a foundational principle: **Prospects leave signals that reveal the gaps you fill. Find those signals, and you find people who have been waiting to hear from you.**

This inverts traditional GTM methodology:

| Traditional Approach | SmokeSignals Approach |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Define ICP based on assumptions | Build ACP from closed-won deal patterns |
| Target demographics | Target behaviors and timing signals |
| High-volume, low-relevance outreach | Low-volume, high-resonance engagement |
| Tool-first implementation | Strategy-first, tool-agnostic execution |
| Generic lead scoring | Signal-driven prioritization |

### The Actual Customer Profile (ACP) Methodology

Rather than hypothesizing ideal customers, ACP analyzes actual closed-won deals to extract behavioral patterns across five dimensions:

1. **Engagement Depth** — How customers interact across touchpoints
2. **Purchase Velocity** — Speed and consistency through the buying process
3. **Expansion Potential** — Early signals predicting account growth
4. **Support Efficiency** — Interaction patterns correlating with account health
5. **Relationship Strength** — Multi-stakeholder engagement indicators

This evidence-based profiling replaces assumption with data, enabling precise targeting and cohort-specific sales strategies.

## The SmokeSignals Thesis

> *"Marketing creates the signal. Sales activates it. But right now, everyone's just increasing the noise. What teams need isn't more tools—it's a system that actually knows what to do when someone raises their hand."*

The companies that win aren't the ones with the most AI tools. They're the ones with signal-driven systems that identify prospects *already experiencing the problem they solve*, reach them at the *moment of maximum urgency*, and engage with *resonant, evidence-based messaging*.

That's what SmokeSignals builds.
